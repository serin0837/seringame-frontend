We've attached a checklist that applies to all React project development. There will be a few things you don't know about yet so you can ignore those steps; for now, the most important things to think about are planning out your app, then constructing a static version with no method or functionality, then making it do stuff!

## Planning

[] Copy this list into your project
[] Outline functionality of your app functionality:
1: display title, items with prices, and a total box as the output
2: take input from the user and add it to the items section
3: update the totals to match the new items list.

[] Draw what the user will see
[] Break out components from your sketch
[] Name your components
[] Draw component hierarchy
[] Label where you will require functions that change state
[] Label where you will require data
[] Determine from this where you will require state & hold functions

## Setup

[] Create your app directory (e.g. with create-react-app)
[] Run your app
[] Ensure you have React DevTools running (in browser)
[ ] Make blank components (functional or class?) as per your plan
[ ] Export and import components as per your hierarchy
[ ] Check everything is hooked up

## Further functionality

[ ] Flesh out your components with methods - this is a pretty big step!

## Style

[ ] Add classNames
[ ] Create and import .css file(s)
